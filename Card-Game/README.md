Card game similar to card-jitsu from Club Penguin. 
Any fire card melts any snow card, any snow card freezes any water card, and any water card extinguishes any fire card.
When two cards of the same suit battle, the card with the highest value wins. 
I may add two player mode soon, but at the moment it's just single player against a random CPU opponent.
